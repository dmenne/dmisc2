Auxillary functions, some from Stack Exchange and r-help postings.
For some of these functions, better alternatives are meanwhile available.

* Construct contrasts in Excel files (not tested on travis); quite useful if you want nicely formatted contrast tables, but only tested on Windows. 
* Pair plots splom type with categorical (http://biostatmatt.com/archives/2398). Quite nice for a first look.
* lattice panel with paging ([Gabor Grothendiek](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9654244/multipage-lattice-panel-arrangement)) and Aaron Rendahl. Still the only game in town to distribute many panels on several pages. There is no equivalent plot in ggplot2. 
* DM's default lattice settings (the function I use most frequently)
* ColorPalettes: Collected from several sources

## Obsolete and removed
* (use survMisc/autoplot.survfit) ggkm: Kaplan-Meier with ggplot2 was removed.
* (use package HDinterval)Kruschke Highest Density interval
